# Lab 1 - Hello World

**Step 1:** I created a sub-package called “controller” in my main package. I then created a class called “HelloWorldController” in my newly created sub-package.

I then added a getter function called `getHelloWorld()` that will return a string.
I also set up the appropriate annotations for spring boot to know that it is a RestController.

**Step 2:** I imported my newly created class to my main program. I then created an object of this new class and used the getter method to access the string. I used this return value to print to the console.
